            <h3 class="sectionTitle">Background &amp; Ideation</h3>
            <p>This project was inspired by the story of <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/12833146/instagram-account-university-pennsylvania-runner-showed-only-part-story" target="_blank">Madison Holleran</a>.
                Madison seemed like a happy college student from her Instagram account. But behind the scenes, this bright student was struggling with mental health. Inspired by this story, we directed our attention to how human behaviors manifest on photographic based social network. 
            </p>
            <p>Through intensive literature review, I found that there is very few existing literature on our research topic. As photography becomes increasingly popular on social networks, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and others, it would be interesting and meaningful to investigate this area.

            <h3 class="sectionTitle">Research Question</h3>
            <p>We were specifically interested in how self-presentation goals guide deception in instagram photos. Our first research question was to find out the prevalence of deceptive behaviors and how people judge their own images as deceptive. Our second research question was what aspects of Instagram images users consider deceptive.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="insta-data">
            <h3 class="sectionTitle">Data Collection Methodologies</h3>
            <p>For both Study 1 and Study 2, we defined a deceptive photo as “<em>any photo you upload that is a deliberate attempt to mislead viewers. Any photo, or accompanying caption, that you think will cause a false belief in the person viewing the photo should be rated as deceptive.</em>”</p>
            <h4 class="procedure">Study 1</h4>
            <p>In our study 1, we recruited participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) (N=213). Participants completed a survey that asks them to upload their nine most recent Instagram posts (see below). They were asked to rate the accuracy of the photo for each post. If the photo was rated as inaccurate, participants were asked to explain the reason that this photo is inaccurate.
            </p>
            <p>I was able to understand the prevalence of deceptive behaviors by checking what percentage of photos were marked as deceptive. Also participants’ reasoning on their own photo gave me a clear picture of how they perceive their own photos.
            </p>
            <p>Data collected from study 1 was analyzed by using descriptive and inferential statistics. 
                </p>
            <p id="insta-note">* Note: Instead of asking users how deceptive your photo is, we asked users how accurate their own photos are. Because from user interview and literature reviews, we found that people are reluctant and undesirable to rate their photo as deceptive (social desirability bias), and also accuracy rating could reduce this bias.
            </p>

            </div>
            
            <h4 class="procedure">Study 2</h4>
            <p>The primary goal of study 2 was to examine in more detail 1) what aspects of their photo users judged as deceptive, and 2) what strategies people use to accomplish these deceptions.  
            </p>
            <p>Participants were recruited from a university campus (N=117). Instead of uploading the most recent nine instagram posts, participants uploaded four of their most deceptive Instagram posts and four of their most honest Instagram posts (they believe).
            </p>
            <p>We used a bottom-up approach to generate qualitative coding categories. There are two emerging patterns from our data, which are shown in the tables below. 
            </p>

        <div id="insta-findings">
            <h3 class="sectionTitle">Key Findings</h3>
            <p>From study 1, our data shows that Instagram users perceive filtering as deceptive, but as a less severe form compared to other forms of photographic deception.   
            </p>
            <p>From study 2, we found that captions were a surprisingly important strategy in deception on Instagram. While photographs on their own can only imply something misleading, users often accompanied a photo with an explicit lie. Despite the emphasis on photos on Instagram, the prevalence of deceptive captions (27%) suggests that textual components remain an important feature on Instagram.  
            </p>
            <p>Consistent with the results from Study 1, the use of filtering tools was the most common deceptive strategies.  
            </p>
            <p>Our data also shows the warrant effect that remarkably less deceptive photos include people in the photo than honest photos. Similarly, another very interesting trend is that there are significantly more group photos in the honest photo category. Connecting this point to the trend of our data that honest photos tend to receive more likes, I can hypothesis that group pictures would receive more likes. This is a potential direction for future researches.

        <div id="insta-implications">
            <h3 class="sectionTitle">Design Implications</h3>
            <p>Our result also surprisingly shows that caption is an essential feature even in Instagram, where photography supposes to be the focus. Users use captions to influence how other people perceive their pictures. My design recommendation is to make caption a more prominent feature. For example, distinguish the format of the first comment from the caption, as the example shows below.  
            </p>
            <div class="sampleImages">
                <figure>
                    <img src="../img/instagram/instagramex.png" alt="Instagram example for design recommendations" />
                    <figcaption><em>Fig 2. A Instagram Post Example for Caption and Comments</em></figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>Based on our data that group photos are more likely to be perceived as honest, my another design recommendation is that Instagram can help to promote honest behaviors by showing more group pictures in users newsfeed. 
            </p>  
            <p>Together the finding that the use of filtering tools was the most common deceptive strategies and the tendency that honest photos receive more likes, my last design recommendation is for Instagram to provide more filters that only slightly filter the photo.
